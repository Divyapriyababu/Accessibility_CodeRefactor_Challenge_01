## About the repository

This repository contains changes to refactor code as part of University of Washington's Coding [bootcamp](https://bootcamp.uw.edu/coding/). There are two types of challenges in this course:

* On-the-job ticket or feature request challenges give a starter code in a folder called Develop, which we'll modify to complete the challenge.

* Job-seeking coding assessments or take-home assignments don't provide starter code. We'll build these from scratch.

## User story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Changes added

* CSS refactoring - consolidating CSS styles and adding comments

* Use semantic elements - Ref.: [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp)

* Add accessible features to the webpage - title, image alt attributes
